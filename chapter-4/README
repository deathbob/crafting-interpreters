I found getting the java stuff compiled and running confusing.

First i had all the files here in the top level directory, and what is now called "Lox.java" as "jlox.java"

Renamed to "Lox.java" still in this top level dir

Created a "lox" dir, moved there

Finally had to create 'com/craftinginterpreters/lox' dir and put all the files in there

from the Directory /Users/robertlarrick/src/crafting-compilers/chapter-4/ -



then compile with `javac com/craftinginterpreters/lox/Lox.java`

and then run with `java com/craftinginterpreters/lox/Lox`  why i have to leave the `.java` off when running the program I will never know.

NOTE TO SELF!  Do not assume any local file system layout when writing my own language.  These assumptions are difficult to understand.
